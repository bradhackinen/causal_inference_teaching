# How to run the pizzeria activity

**Preparation (before class):**

- Print and cut out the PO slips from `pizzeria_slips.pdf` (in the `Activities` folder). Each potential outcome represents the number of pizza slices a student would buy under each treatment condition (flyer or no flyer).
- You will need one slip per student. Try to maintain the rough frequency of each type of slip.
- Put the following table on a whiteboard.
    - Table columns:
        - Strategy
        - \# Flyers
        - Sales
            - $D_i$=0
            - $D_i$=1
            - Total
        - "ROI"
        - *Leave room for a "True ROI" column at the end.*
    - Table rows:
        - Flyers to all
        - In line only
        - Not in line only
        - *Leave room for a "No flyers" row at the bottom.*

**In class:**

1. Ask for two volunteers to be assistant marketers. They will help tally results on the board.
2. Split PO slips into "in line" (P(0)>0) and "not in line" (P(0)=0) stacks and deal out slips to students. About 30-40% of students should be in line. It can be helpful to make the first row "in line" and the back rows "not in line". Meanwhile, have assistants hand out flyers to everyone.
3. Cold call a few students and ask them to look at their slips and interpret them. What are their potential outcomes? What is their treatment status? What is their observed outcome? Have them place their slips face-up on their desks with their observed outcome visible.
4. Tally up the total amount of pizza slices purchased in this scenario. Fill out the columns on the board, including computing the "ROI" for this strategy.
    - Repeat for the "in line only" strategy (it's sufficient to just have students *imagine* that only the in-line students got flyers).
    - Repeat for the "not in line only" and "no flyers" strategies.
5. Ask students which marketing strategy they think is best and why. Is the "ROI" a good measure of success? Why or why not? If all has gone as planned, the "in line only" strategy should have the highest ROI, even though students should see that there is something fishy going on.
6. Add a "True ROI" column to the table and ask how it should be computed. Try to get students to see that they are going to need to know the counterfactual outcome for a "no flyers" strategy.
7. Quickly fill out a new row for the "no flyers" strategy. This is easy since we know the total sales when no flyers were handed out to each group of students. 
8. Use the "no flyers" sales to compute the "True ROI" for each strategy. This metric should ran the "not in line only" strategy as the best. All other strategies will likely have negative true ROI.
9. Discuss the differences between the observed "ROI"s and the true ROIs. What do businesses need to know to make good decisions? How can we get that information? (this last question does not need to be fully answered yet)
